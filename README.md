# 👋 Hey there, I’m @pavel-douglas

I'm a software engineer with a love for sleek UIs, smart architectures, and developer-first tools. I specialize in **React** and the modern declarative stack — think hooks, signals, atoms, and everything that makes code expressive and fun to work with.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Building next-gen web experiences with **React**, **Three.js**, **PlayCanvas**, and **WebGL**
- Exploring the edges of **reactive programming** — from fine-grained reactivity to streaming data flows
- Tinkering with **LLMs** and AI to create intelligent, adaptive interfaces
- Tools that make developers feel **10x smarter** — editors, compilers, and live playgrounds

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Rust & WebAssembly (because who doesn't want blazingly fast + safe?)
- LLM internals & prompt engineering
- Building real-time, multiplayer-friendly UI systems

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Declarative UI libraries and visual tooling
- Smart coding environments and playgrounds
- Open-source projects where **DX** (Developer Experience) is king

## 😄 Pronouns:

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I once built a game engine in the browser just to prototype ideas faster. Performance matters, but velocity is 🔥.

Let's build the future of the web — composable, reactive, intelligent.
